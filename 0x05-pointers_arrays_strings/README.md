# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings


C is a programming language that supports pointers, arrays, and strings as fundamental concepts.

* Pointers: In C, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used to manipulate data indirectly and to pass data between functions. Pointers are denoted by the * symbol in C.

* Arrays: In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store and manipulate collections of data. Array elements are accessed using an index, starting from 0.

* Strings: In C, a string is a sequence of characters stored in an array of characters. Strings are terminated with a null character (\0). C provides a number of functions for manipulating strings, such as strlen() for getting the length of a string and strcpy() for copying one string to another.

Pointers, arrays, and strings are closely related in C. For example, an array name can be treated as a pointer to its first element, and pointers can be used to manipulate strings by accessing their individual characters. Additionally, pointers are often used to dynamically allocate memory for arrays and strings, allowing for more flexible memory management in C programs.
