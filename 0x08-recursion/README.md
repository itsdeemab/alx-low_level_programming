# x08. C - Recursion

Have you ever played with a set of Russian dolls that fit inside each other? Each doll has a smaller doll inside it, and that smaller doll also has an even smaller doll inside it, and so on.

Recursion in programming is like playing with those dolls. A function calls itself and creates a smaller version of itself. And that smaller version also calls itself and creates an even smaller version of itself, and so on.

Just like with the dolls, you can keep going until you reach the smallest version of the function, which doesn't call itself anymore. And then all the bigger versions of the function start completing their tasks one by one until the original function finishes too.

So, recursion is like breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, and solving each smaller piece one by one until you've solved the original problem.
