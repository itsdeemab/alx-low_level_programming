# 0x08. C - Recursion

Have you ever played with a set of Russian dolls that fit inside each other? Each doll has a smaller doll inside it, and that smaller doll also has an even smaller doll inside it, and so on.

Recursion in programming is like playing with those dolls. A function calls itself and creates a smaller version of itself. And that smaller version also calls itself and creates an even smaller version of itself, and so on.

Just like with the dolls, you can keep going until you reach the smallest version of the function, which doesn't call itself anymore. And then all the bigger versions of the function start completing their tasks one by one until the original function finishes too.

So, recursion is like breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, and solving each smaller piece one by one until you've solved the original problem.

### Tasks

0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
* Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`
* File: `0-puts_recursion.c`

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
* Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`
* File: `1-print_rev_recursion.c`

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
* Prototype: `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`
* File: 2-strlen_recursion.c

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
* Prototype: `int factorial(int n);`
* File: `3-factorial.c`

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
* Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`
* File: `4-pow_recursion.c`

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
* Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`
* File: `5-sqrt_recursion.c`

6. Inception. Is it possible?
* Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n);`
* File: `6-is_prime_number.c`

### Advaced

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
* Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s);`
* File: `100-is_palindrome.c`

8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
* Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
* File: `101-wildcmp.c`
